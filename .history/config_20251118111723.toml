Extract the following fields from the paper:

- pid:
  The persistent identifier (PID) of the study, ideally the DOI in the form "10.xxxx/...".
  If multiple DOIs exist, pick the DOI of the main study. If none, use another registration ID (e.g., ISRCTN, ClinicalTrials.gov). Otherwise return null.

- study_name:
  The full canonical name of the study or cohort (e.g., “Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children”). 
  Use the study name, not the paper title, if both appear.

- study_acronym:
  Extract the acronym explicitly associated with the study (e.g., “ALSPAC”, “UK Biobank”). 
  If no acronym is given, return null.

- study_types:
  Extract all applicable high-level study types as strings. Allowed labels:
  "Biobank", "Cohort study", "Clinical trial", "Registry", "Network", "Other type".
  If the study fits multiple categories, return all.

- cohort_type:
  If this is a cohort study, extract the specific subtype:
  examples: “birth cohort”, “prospective cohort”, “retrospective cohort”, “population-based cohort”, 
  “hospital-based cohort”, “longitudinal cohort”. 
  If not applicable or not specified, return null.

- n_included:
  The number of INCLUDED participants in the final analytic cohort (not screened / not eligible / not excluded).

- countries:
  List the countries of the INCLUDED participants only.
  Return each country VERBATIM. Deduplicate. Exclude author affiliations and non-contributing sites.
